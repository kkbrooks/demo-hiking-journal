- Our UI/UX documentation should always include an image of the pattern or component at the top of the page.
- It should always include the author's name and when it was last updated.
- The document should always be titled with the name of the pattern or component
- It should always describe a description of the pattern or the component and how its used.
- Describe how the pattern or component is structured. Call out any nested components or sub-components used.
- When referencing any colors, spacing sizes, corner radii, or stroke widths, always reference the token used and not the rendered color or size. For things that don't use tokens, list the hard coded value with a note that it should be replaced by a variable or token.
