# Hike to Rector Reservoir Wildlife Area

<!-- Date -->
March 23, 2025

<!-- Location -->
7199-7185 Silverado Trail, Napa, CA 94558

<!-- Description -->
We hiked up to the top of the ridge that looks down on the reservoir on the east side and out over the valley on the other. Its a beautiful view after the initial steep climb. After the first half of the trail, there was so much poison oak growing on either side of the trail. Next time we hike here, we'll need to remember to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes.
